# surveysaurus-android

In this project, our team wanted to create a survey app. In this app you can;
- Create Surveys
- Open accounts to save your surveys
- Answer the surveys created by other people
- See the percentage of options voted in the poll
- Many other features

We mostly used *Kotlin* instead of Java to create our app because Kotlin lets us to be more concise with out code. It's also compatible with Java.
